# django_stock_portfolio
## A django project that I created

All visitors can view a list of my past investments. To create, update, or delete items, I can simply login and make selections in the UI.  
The trading price of US-based stocks (listed on NYSE/NASDAQ) is updated daily via AWS Lambda.


Uses:
 - Django MVC w/ fat models and skinny views
 - PostgreSQL database
 - Docker
 - Javascript for DOM manipulation & variable computation
 - AWS Lambda
 - AWS RDS

Utulizes:
- unit testing (models, views, urls, and forms)
- class-based views
- fixtures (for default stock data)
- Template inheritance
- virtual environment & protected environment variables
- gitignore & dockerignore
